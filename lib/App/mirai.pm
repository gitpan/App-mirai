=head1 NAME

App::mirai - debugging for L<Future>-based code

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Run the Tickit interface, and have it load the script as a separate process, directing
 # STDOUT/STDERR to windows in the UI and communicating via pipepair
 mirai script.pl

 # eventually, the following options may also be added:

 # start an IO::Async::Listener on the given port/socket file. Means the event loop needs to
 # be running, but should be able to hook into an existing application without too much trouble.
 # Some complications around Future nesting (Futures are created by the debugger itself) but
 # that's easy enough to work around
 perl -d:Mirai=localhost:1234 script.pl
 perl -d:Mirai=/tmp/mirai.sock script.pl
 
 # Run Tickit interface directly, presuming that the code itself is silent - everything is
 # in-process, so no need for debugging to go via pipes
 perl -Mirai script.pl
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a basic debugging interface for tracing and interacting with L<Future>s. This should
allow you to see the L<Future> instances currently in use in a piece of code, and what their
current status is.

The UI is currently L<Tickit>-based.

=end HTML

There's a web interface in the works as well.

The name "mirai" (未来) was chosen because it's short and somewhat related to the concept
of the code, plus it seemed like a better option than chigiri (契り) at the time.

=head2 SERIALISATION

Defines the serialisation format to use.

Prefers L<Sereal> if available, will fall back to JSON via L<JSON::MaybeXS>. Set
C< MIRAI_SERIALISATION > in the environment to override:
